IFHA stands for Inter-Faith Humanitarian Alliance, For three years, the country
grappled with a global health pandemic that had huge repercussions on the lives
of its citizens. In the fight against COVID-19, those on the frontlines have
been further challenged by widespread misinformation regarding safety protocols
and vaccination hesitancy during the rollout of COVID-19 immunizations. The most
vulnerable groups in the community are largely the victims of this, leading to a
further increase in their vulnerabilities. Stigma and discrimination towards
those affected by the virus continues unabated. Faith leaders and spiritual
healers have played a critical role during humanitarian emergencies and natural
disasters. They are usually the first responders in a crisis in a community,
providing and facilitating response on the ground. They also hold the unique
position to influence community behaviour, and bring about attitudinal changes.
In the context of the pandemic, their messages and information sent out to their
followers has been an effective means of outreach to the masses. Their moral
authority has also played a critical role in facilitating the promotion of
COVID-19 appropriate behaviour, dispel rumours and fight the onslaught of
misinformation. Faith based leaders are respected figures in the community and
are routinely engaged in conversations around socially acceptable behaviors with
key stakeholders such as parents, teachers, community influencers and panchayat
members, and current government and community-based organizations that are the
social protection infrastructure within a district. Since 2020, Sphere India, in
collaboration with other partners, the Interfaith Humanitarian Alliance (IFHA)
was established with the primary objective to foster collaboration and
cooperation among different religious and faith-based groups to address
humanitarian and developmental challenges effectively. Recognizing the diverse
religious landscape in India, IFHA aimed to bring together representatives and
leaders from various faiths to work towards common goals in humanitarian action.
The IFHA functions as a platform for interfaith dialogue, knowledge-sharing, and
joint initiatives to build resilience and provide timely support to affected
communities. Through its inclusive and multi-faith approach, the alliance aimed
to foster greater understanding, empathy, and unity among religious groups while
collectively working towards alleviating the suffering of vulnerable
populations. Overall, the Interfaith Humanitarian Alliance plays a vital role in
promoting interfaith harmony and cooperation in humanitarian and development
efforts, making it a significant force in fostering positive change and
compassionate action across Indiaâ€™s diverse society
